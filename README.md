## **stuntung** : Growth faltering risk factors among children under 5 years old in south asia region

UN framework expalin mechanism of growth faltering among children. 
Base level cause is driven by SES, inadequate social capital, and education inequality. 
Underlying cause is food insecurity, or missing feeding practice by lack of proper education, health inequality 
These two drive to Direct cause of undernutrition. Which is inadequate dietary intake or disease that prvents absortion of nutrient. 


### Background and problems 
- Health impact from intrauterine growth retardation (Demerath et al. 2009)
- Global growth faltering onset at 3 months and SA shows worse level than other regions. (Shrimpton et al. 2001)
- Lack of robust global reference on growth faltering and regional variation (Maleta et al. 2003)

### Research question & objective 
- What is relation between growth faltering outcomes by function of age of child?
- How is the relation varies over regional level versus country level?
- Is there heterogeneity amongst country for the identified risk factors? 
- Do we have similar situation among communities? 

### Outcome

From the model, we drived commonly stand out/ statisfically signification risk factors to cause stunting. 
First risk is found among the children who are not the first child. 
This may be due to biological limitation of motherâ€™s after first child birth or due to lack of economic power to provide same amount of nutrition practice for the another member of family than when the family is one person less. However, as Harriot mentioned, it is portion of food for young children is tiny to believe that it may cause by economic burden. But we can think of more increase of expenditure due to child birth. 
One interesting factor is that Maldives shows slight opposite pattern of the regression coefficient direction than other countries.

Similar to the previous risk factor, Maldives stand out when it comes to the open defecation related risk to stunting. 
Maldives shows generally higher coefficient of open defecation driven risks. But it is too early to draw conclusion for this specific country because of very low adjusted r square value. 

Mostly, the open defecation is linked to stunting prevalence between <24 motnhs old children vs >24 months olds.
Interestingly, in Nepal, the impact of open defecation to stunting shows opposite pattern.
